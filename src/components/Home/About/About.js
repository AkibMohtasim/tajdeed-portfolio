        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          As a recent Civil and Environmental Engineering graduate, I have
          gained valuable experience working as a geotechnical and project
          engineer for a local consultancy firm for almost a year. While my
          undergraduate studies were important, I also found time to pursue my
          passions for sports, photography, and travel. On the field, I am a
          skilled football player, and I have had the opportunity to participate
          in many competitive matches. Off the field, I enjoy capturing the
          beauty of the world through photography, and I have been fortunate to
          travel to many stunning locations throughout my life. My diverse range
          of interests has helped me to develop a well-rounded perspective,
          which I believe is an asset in the engineering field. I am committed
          to using my skills and experience to contribute to meaningful projects
          that make a positive impact on society. Thank you for taking the time
          to learn a little about me. I am excited about the opportunity to
          connect with others and to explore new challenges and opportunities in
          my career.
