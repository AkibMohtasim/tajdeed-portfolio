# A Portfolio Website for a friend

[Live Site](https://tajdeed-portfolio.web.app/)

## Frameworks and Libraries

This is a Single Page Application. It is created with React and React Router. The styling was done primarily with Vanilla CSS and a little bit of BootStrap. The animations were created using Vanilla CSS and JavaScript.

## Data

This is mainly a static website, but I created JSON data locally and stored inside the "public" folder; from where I loaded the data in the necessary pages.
